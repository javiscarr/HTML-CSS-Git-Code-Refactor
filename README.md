# HTML/CSS/Git: Code Refactoring 
        for client: Horiseon

## Description:

    The motivation and goal behind this project was to create an effective yet well organized web page that is 
    accessible, has clean and neat coding, active hyperlinks, positioned properly and meets the client's
    request to meet search engine optimization. 

    After successfully modifying the layout of code, the webpage is now separated into adequate sections and is
    now easily readable to the user. The user is now able to use the links in the navigation bar to navigate to
    the related article within the body. 

    Before modifying the code, there was an issue with the article content as there was only one section created for all three articles. To solve this problem, I simply created a section for each article and defined a class for each article along with creating an id selector to navigate the links above to the appropriate article.

    Another issue was with the aside element. It was originally listed below the section element in the html code which caused it to warp and not fully commit to the area in which it was defined to take place. However, once I move the aide element above the section code, the content began to take the parameters set within the .css code.


In this assignment I learned that the placement of code sometimes determine how code will be affected on the webpage as well as creating a div element for each section within the aside element to create a separate content section for each area.

## Usage

User is able to browse the site and use hyperlinks provided to navigate the page as well as easily read content.
